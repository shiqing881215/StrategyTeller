Something we need to clarify first : 
1) I don't think it's a self deception proof. 
   I'm not going to get the best profit from history data
   What I'm doing is set a strategy first, follow that strategy
   and calculate the profit.
   The strategy has a few variables, so by comparing different variable 
   combination. We can know the one to get most profit
2) I'm NOT predicting future price. What I want to do is 
   stick with strategy and see whether it can beat if I just hold it. 
   Ideally, we should use future data to test this. (I don't do here)

We can see a few insights : 
1) Consider all 3 variables (minimumDownPercentage/sellTriggerPercentage/upPercentageToBuy)
   can get better result than 2 variables (minimumDownPercentage/sellTriggerPercentage)
2) Both situation, strategy can works better than holding
   64.1 vs 51.0 (25.7%)(2014/05/06 - 2019/05/06)
   37.7 vs 25.1 (48.6%)(2014/05/06 - 2018/12/31)
3) Then could you say we should use strategy than holding ? Not really
   Because to use strategy, you have to figure the best combination of all variables 
   but the best combination of 3 variables really depends on the ending price
   And a lot of variable combination actually can NOT win by just holding
   
   This is the simple compare of the best variable results in two data sets as 
   42% 30% 10% (2014/05/06 - 2019/05/06)
   14% 8%  41% (2014/05/06 - 2018/12/31)
   You can see the big difference
   
   So the best variable combination varies heavily based on the provided data shape.
4) Technically we should be able to calculate all cases 100^3 to count 
   how many times strategy wins vs holding wins. And how much each of them win. 
   
 
 To be honest, we haven't think these
 1) whether 5 years data is good enough
 2) commission fee/tax when we sell
 
 The more I look at this, the more I feel I probably just want to hold it. 
 But the big resistance from my heart is "Do I really hold it even if it has drop more than 50% ?"
